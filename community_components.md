# Community components

These are several components built by the CHAOSS/GrimoireLab community,
interacting with GrimoireLab at some level,
which are not currently a part of the "official" GrimoireLab components.
Please, have a look at them, use them, and provide as much feedback on them as possible!

If you want your component to be listed here, just produce a pull request to this file.

## Collections of panels

Collections of panels alternative or complementary to those in
[grimoirelab-sigils](http://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sigils)

* [Ben Lloyd Pearson panels](https://github.com/BenLloydPearson/grimoirelab-dashboards)
by [Ben Lloyd Pearson](https://github.com/BenLloydPearson).

## Software components

Software components interoperating with GrimoireLab, either complementary
or alternative:

* [Graal](https://github.com/valeriocos/graal) by [Valerio Cosentino](https://valeriocos.github.io/):
Generic Repository AnALyzer Build Status Coverage Status.
Graal leverages on the Git backend of Perceval and enhances it to set up ad-hoc source code analysis. 
It fetches commits from a Git repository and provides a mechanism to plug third party tools/libraries 
focused on source code analysis.

## Integrations

Integrations of GrimoireLab components, usually with some other software:

* [Augur](https://github.com/OSSHealth/augur).
Functionally, Augur is a prototyped implementation of the 
Linux Foundation's CHAOSS Project on open source software metrics.
Augur is a sister project in CHAOSS, using Perceval (a GrimoireLab component) 
for retrieving data from some of its data sources.

* [Data visualization for open source software development](https://github.com/zhquan/TFG/)
by [Quan Zhou](https://github.com/zhquan).
Master thesis which consists of a completely automated system that provides
a web interface for configuring GrimoireLab, so that it analyizes any set of
repositories. [More information (in Spanish)](http://zhquan.github.io/TFG/).

* [Prospector](https://github.com/chaoss/prospector).
Prospector permits automated collection of a wide range of metrics of open source projects 
useful in evaluating the project.
Prospector is a sister project in CHAOSS, using Perceval (a GrimoireLab component) 
for retrieving data from its data sources.
