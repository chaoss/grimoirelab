# Contributing to GrimoireLab

There are multiple ways to contribute to GrimoireLab. You can help other
users solve their issues running the platform, report issues you might have
found using in our software, propose new ideas, improve documentation,
and even write code to add new features or fix existing bugs.

The following is information and general guidelines for collaborating with us.

## Before You Contribute

Before opening a new discussion, bug, issue, etc, please check if similar one
has already been reported. This helps us avoid duplication of effort and keeps
our discussions and issues focused.

Also, please check our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/chaoss/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
GrimoireLab is part of the [CHAOSS Collaborative Project](http://chaoss.community)
and any participation in their projects is subject to their Code of Conduct.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find an error while running the platform, we would appreciate you
opening an issue to report it.

As GrimoireLab is built by several components across some GitHub repositories,
You may not know exactly where to open the issue. Unless you know
exactly on which component the bug is, open the issue on the main repository.
Maintainers will move the issue if they see the issue is related to another
repository.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have ideas for improvements or new features, feel free to open a new
discussion or issue to share them. We appreciate well-documented
enhancement suggestions. You can also have at look to our [ROADMAP](./ROADMAP.md)
to check if your proposal is aligned with the current direction of the
platform.

### Writing Code

All contributions to current repositories in GrimoireLab will be received as
pull requests in the corresponding repository. GitHub has a
[complete guide](https://docs.github.com/es/pull-requests) on
collaborating via pull requests but, in short, you will do the following:

1. Fork the repository.
1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
1. Make your changes and test them thoroughly.
1. Create a pull request (PR) with a clear title and description.
1. Ensure your PR follows our coding standards.

If you're interested in contributing with code, please also have a look
at the specifics in our [CONTRIBUTING WITH CODE](./CONTRIBUTING_WITH_CODE.md)
document.
