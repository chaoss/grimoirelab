**Others:**

 * struclog added for logging platform messages\
   Organizing log data in a structured format makes easier to read and
   analyze it. After adding 'structlog', log messages will always have a
   structured format. The default mode prints the messages to the console
   in plain format, but it can also be configured to print them in JSON
   format by setting the environment variable 'GRIMOIRELAB_LOGS_JSON' to
   1 or 'true'.
