  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### sortinghat

**New features:**

 * Skip recommendations (#937)\
   Users can now skip a recommendation and review the next one if they
   are unsure of whether to apply it or dismiss it.
 * Sort organizations by number of enrollments (#940)\
   Organizations are now sorted by the number of enrollments they have by
   default. Clicking on a column header sorts the table results by that
   field.

### cereslib
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### perceval

**Bug fixes:**

 * Git stats not assigned with their actions\
   Git stats were not assigned to their actions in a commit for filenames
   that contain whitespaces. Instead, an empty stat was created like in a
   merge commit, where actions normally don't take place.

**Performance improvements:**

 * Git sync improved for `--latest-items` flag\
   The speed updating a git repository when `--lates-items` is set was
   very poor. The main problem was when the references were updated to
   the new hashes. All the active refs on the repository were modified,
   even when they were up-to-date. Now, only references updated on the
   remote repository are modified on the local one. Repositories are
   synched 2 times faster than before.

   Remove old format to define namespace packages. And use native
   namespace packages that requires removing the `__init__.py` file. It
   is important that every distribution that uses the namespace package
   omits that file. For more information see
   https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/

### grimoire-elk
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### sirmordred

**Bug fixes:**

 * Panels import bug and Micro Mordred failure\
   A bug was causing Panels to fail to import in Kibiter and preventing
   micro Mordred from working. The issue was in tasks that didn’t require
   a SortingHat client to run.

**New features:**

 * Mark individuals as reviewed\
   Individuals can now be marked as reviewed to keep track of which
   profiles have already been checked and when. A profile can be marked
   as reviewed more than once, it will show the date of the last review.
   If there have been any changes to the profile data since the last
   review, the review button displays a warning icon. The list of
   individuals can be filtered by whether they have been reviewed and by
   their review date. The list can also be ordered by review date.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Wrong arrong direction when merging recommendations (#934)\
   When recommendations were merged, the arrow showing the direction of
   the merge was wrong. It showed `foo → bar` but the resulting identity
   will be named `foo` instead of `bar`. The arrow now points in the
   other direction showing that `bar` will be merged on `foo`.

**New features:**

 * Keywords data on enriched items\
   Keywords field is included now on the enriched items of bugzilla and
   bugzillarest indices.
 * New reponse times on bugzilla items\
   The Bugzilla enriched items include two new fields to track response
   times on these type of repositories. The field
   `time_to_first_attention` is the the time expressed in days between
   the ticket creation and the first comment from a contributor different
   from the author creating the bug. The field `last_comment_date` is the
   date of the last comment posted in the bug.

**Bug fixes:**

 * All references processed for the reference analysis study\
   The `enrich_reference_analysis` study analyzes the cross-references
   between "issues" and "pull request". When we use an aggregations
   query, it returns only the first 10 items (ElasticSearch/OpenSearch by
   default). By using 'composite aggregations', we can paginate the
   result and thus, obtain all the references.

### sirmordred
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

   Python 3.8 will reach its end of life in October 2024. Python 3.9 is
   the minimum version required by the project.

### sortinghat

**New features:**

 * Less distracting main identity indicator (#920)\
   The star icon that marked an individual's main identity was
   distracting and potentially misleading for users. It has changed to a
   more subtle indicator since it is not relevant for most users.
 * Redirect to the original URL after log in (#925)\
   Users are now redirected to the page they originally requested after
   they log in.
 * Merge organizations when adding an alias\
   Users now have the option to merge the organizations when adding an
   alias that already exists on the "Edit organization" dialog. That
   option was only previously available at the organization's detail
   page.
 * Customizable trusted sources for username matching\
   Enable customization of trusted sources for username matching in
   settings. This feature allows to define and manage the trusted data
   sources for username matching from the configuration.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Users permissions migrated (#849)\
   User permissions are stored in a separate table within the database.
   These permissions will be automatically migrated when running
   `sortinghat-admin upgrade`.
 * Update workspace when identities are split (#919)\
   When an individual's identities are split, they are shown in the
   workspace, but they were only shown the first time. The workspace is
   now updated with the new individuals every time.

**Dependencies updateds:**

 * Python minimum version updated\
   Python 3.8 will reach its end of life in October 2024. Python 3.9 is
   the minimum version required by the project. Update the Docker images
   to use Python 3.9.

### grimoire-elk

**New features:**

 * Status in SUMO enriched index\
   Add the missing status in the SUMO backend. The status could be
   `solved`, `archived`, `locked` or `open`.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Avoid UNDEFINED values in author fields\
   Avoid `-- UNDEFINED --` values for all SortingHat fields when Mordred
   loses connection to the SortingHat server during the enrichment or
   autorefresh execution. It will keep the values of the `name`, `email`,
   `id` and `uuid` fields.
 * Handle OpenSearch page info on pagination\
   In OpenSearch and ElasticSearch < 7.x the page info on pagination is
   different. This will handle both of them.

**Dependencies updateds:**

 * Python minimum version updated\
   Python 3.8 will reach its end of life in October 2024. Python 3.9 is
   the minimum version required by the project.

## GrimoireLab 1.5.0 - (2024-08-30)

**New components:**

* kidash 1.0.5
* sortinghat 1.3.0
* perceval 1.0.6
* perceval-mozilla 1.0.6
* perceval-opnfv 1.0.6
* perceval-puppet 1.0.6
* perceval-weblate 1.0.6
* graal 1.0.6
* grimoire-elk 1.1.5
* sirmordred 1.1.0

The following list describes the changes by component:

### kidash
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### sortinghat

**New features:**

 * Remove merge recommendations (#883)\
   Recommendations can now be deleted from the database and not just
   dismissed. This is useful in case there are too many recommendations
   to handle manually.
 * Merge organizations when adding an alias (#913)\
   When adding an alias on an organization's page, if the new alias is an
   existing organization, users now have the option to merge them. This
   is useful in cases where organizations can't be merged using drag and
   drop.
 * User permissions per tenant\
   Update the permissions system to allow assigning permissions to users
   based on the tenant they are accessing. The command `sortinghat-admin
   set-group` has been renamed to `sortinghat.-admin set-permissions`.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Duplicated GitHub links (#912)\
   The link to an individual's GitHub profile no longer appears several
   times when there is more than one GitHub identity.
 * Connection closed when job is executed\
   RQ workers create a fork to run the jobs. The issue arises when, after
   completing the job, the MariaDB logs display the warning: `Aborted
   connection to db. Got an error reading communication packets`. This
   change ensures the database connection is closed before the fork ends,
   preventing the warning from appearing.

### perceval

**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix issue #782 (#782)\
   The issue was that perceval would not delete old tags from upstream
   references. This change deletes tags locally if tags are deleted
   upstream.

### perceval-mozilla
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### perceval-opnfv
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### perceval-puppet
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### perceval-weblate
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### graal
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### grimoire-elk

**Bug fixes:**

 * Git branches study improved\
   Previously, while the branches study was running, the `branches` field
   remained empty or partially filled until the study was completed,
   leading to incorrect data being displayed on the dashboard. With this
   change, the branches field is updated only after the study has
   finished.

### sirmordred

**Performance improvements:**

 * Reduced the number of connections to SortingHat\
   Mordred makes a lot of connections to the SortingHat server which
   could cause the uWSGI queue to fill up. When the uWSGI queue is full,
   Mordred cannot connect to the SortingHat server.


# GrimoireLab 1.0.0

For eight years, we have been working to produce the best platform for
software development analytics possible. With the work of more than
150 developers and after over 11,600 commits, we’re excited to announce
the release of the first major version of GrimoireLab.

GrimoireLab is an evolution of the work done during more than 10 years by
[Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/), LibreSoft URJC research group, and several
contributors in [Metrics Grimoire](http://metricsgrimoire.github.io/)
and [VizGrimorie](http://vizgrimoire.bitergia.org/) projects.
Since 2017, GrimoireLab has been part of The Linux Foundation
[CHAOSS Software](http://chaoss.community) community as one of its founding
projects.

GrimoireLab has become the de facto standard for open source project
health dashboards. It has been used by some of the most important
software companies and open source foundations in the world.
The platform has also been used as the underlying foundation for
other applications, including
[Bitergia Analytics](https://github.com/bitergia-analytics),
[OSS Compass](https://compass.gitee.com/),
[LFX Insights](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/insights/),
[Cauldron](https://gitlab.com/cauldronio/), and
[Mystic](https://opensource.ieee.org/rit/mystic-group).

This release of GrimoireLab includes:

- An automated platform to generate software analytics and insights.
- Data collection from more than 30 data sources.
- Generation of more than 150 metrics and visualizations to understand activity,
  performance, and community of open source projects.
- Identities manager to track the activity of an individual across platforms
  and organizations.
- Integration with third-party applications to visualize and analyze data
  (Kibana/OpenSearch Dashboards/Jupiter Notebooks).

This release would not have been possible without the help of the entire
community. We are deeply thankful to all our users. We would especially
like to thank Álvaro del Castillo, Valerio Cosentino, Jesús González-Barahona,
Alberto Pérez García-Plaza, J. Manrique López, Venu Vardhan Reddy Tekula,
David Moreno, Gregorio Robles, Andy Grunwald, and the members of the
CHAOSS project.

Special recognition to [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/) and
[The Document Foundation](https://www.documentfoundation.org/)
for being early adopters.

The GrimoireLab Developers.

   one of its aliases returns the organization. When an organization is
   merged into another, its name becomes an alias of the target
   organization. If a name exists as an alias, no organization can be
   created with that name and viceversa. An organization's aliases can be
   added and deleted both on the organizations table and the single
   organization view.

**New features:**

 * Unify identities with same source\
   Include a new option to only recommend or unify identities from
   trusted sources like GitHub or GitLab that have the same username and
   backend.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Use correct base URL for login and change password API calls (#851)\
   The URLs called to login and change password now use the public path
   found in vue.config.js if no API URL is specified.
 * Authentication required fixed\
   When the AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED setting is set to False, any query to
   the API is allowed.
 * Display individual's most recent organization\
   The individual's current affiliation is now the most recent one
   instead of the oldest.
 * CSRF token is only required on web requests\
   The GraphQL API required the 'X-CSRFToken' header, but the token could
   only be retrieved by making a GET request. Now, requests authenticated
   using JWT don't need to provide the CSRF token and only the user
   interface, which is vulnerable to CSRF attacks and uses a different
   authentication, requires it.

**Performance improvements:**

 * Performance of organizations query\
   Improve organization query for the table by avoiding individual
   queries.

**New features:**

 * Recommendations for individuals modified after a given date (#813)\
   Users can generate merge and affiliation recommendations for
   individuals that have been created or modified after a date specified
   with the `last_modified` parameter.
 * Add individual to workspace from their profile page (#816)\
   A new button on the individual's profile page allows users to save the
   identity in the workspace to continue working with it later on the
   dashboard.
 * Cache individuals table data (#821)\
   Using cached queries prevents the table from refetching all the data
   from the server everytime any information is edited. This is
   particularly helpful if there is a huge number of identities, where
   reloading the table is very slow. However, there are some cases when
   the queries need to be refetched, eg. when identities are merged or
   split.

   The raw data generated by the graal backend had non-anonymized URLs on
   the meta fields 'origin' and 'tag'. This was necessary to generate
   enriched data for non-public repositories.

**Performance improvements:**

 * Enrichment processing time reduced by 50%\
   The general performance was improved reducing the number of calls to
   the identities manager (i.g. `SortingHat`). There were some deprecated
   calls that weren't needed any longer and also, we increased the cache
   of individuals in ELKs. We were also able to reduce the processing
   time of the Git backend by converting commit dates only once.

The following list describes the changes by component:

### sortinghat

**New features:**

 * Merge organizations (#571)\
   Merging organizations automatically moves all the domains, teams and
   enrollments to the target organization. This is helpful in case an
   organization has duplicates or if an organization absorbs another one.
   Organizations can be merged using drag and drop on the user interface.
 * Recommendations by individual (#779)\
   Users can generate matching recommendations for a specific individual
   by clicking on the drop down menu on each individual or on the
   individual's profile.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Show hidden buttons when the mouse is over the table row (#787)\
   The buttons to lock an individual or mark it as a bot were only
   visible when the mouse wass over the individual's name, which made it
   hard to find them. Now they appear when the mouse is over the table
   row.
 * Email affiliation error (#793)\
   Fix an error when the email domain ends with a dot, causing the
   affiliation process to stop.
 * ADD button doesn't affiliate individuals to organizations\
   Affiliating an individual to an organization using the "+ ADD" button
   on the table expanded view failed.
 * Enrollment filter on organizations view\

   returned results of organizations that contained that name. The filter
   now only returns organizations that match the exact name.

### cereslib
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### perceval

**New features:**

 * Git backend alternates mechanism\
   Git alternates is a mechanism that lets a repository borrow objects
   from another repository on the same machine.  Allow to execute Git
   Perceval backend using this mechanism.

### sortinghat

**New features:**

 * Show when tables are loading (#772)\
   The individuals and organizations tables now show a progress bar to
   indicate that the items are loading.
 * Organization profiles\
   Each organization's full profile is available by clicking its name on
   the table or at `/organization/<organization name>`. This view shows
   the organization's teams, members and domains.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Sort jobs from newest to oldest (#769)\
   The jobs page now sorts the list from newest to oldest to show running
   jobs first.
 * Unreadable large numbers in pagination (#770)\
   Large page numbers were not fully visible in the tables pagination.
 * Edit a profile name with the pencil button (#773)\
   Clicking on an invidual's name no longer activates the edition mode.
   The name can now be edited with the pencil button.
 * Fix enrollment in individual's profile\
   In the individual's profile, the button to add an organization was not
   working.
 * Job timeouts\
   Jobs failed because they exceeded the default timeout while running
   tasks involving numerous identities. To ensure successful completion,
   we adjusted the timeout setting to an infinite duration, allowing jobs
   to finish without interruptions.

**Breaking changes:**

 * Multi-tenancy using headers\
   Tenants are now selected using the `sortinghat-tenant` header instead
   of the host. Proxies and clients using multi-tenancy should include
   that header.

**Performance improvements:**

 * Performance improved for recommendations and merging jobs\
   The performance of the matching and merging algorithms that are used
   on these jobs have been considerably improved. These jobs will be 4
   times faster than on the previous version.
 * uWSGI threads and workers\
   Include two new environments variables to define the number of threads
   and workers for uWSGI. These new variables are
   `SORTINGHAT_UWSGI_WORKERS` and `SORTINGHAT_UWSGI_THREADS`
 * SortingHat database performance\
   Improve SortingHat performance when there are a lot of individuals in
   the database.

**Dependencies updateds:**

 * Update dependencies\
   Include google-auth as a dependency to fix release issues.

   all clients during execution.

### sirmordred

**New features:**

 * Optional configuration for SortingHat\
   Include an optional configuration for SortingHat to define the name of
   the tenant when multi-tenancy is enabled.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Race condition initializing SirMordred\
   There was a race condition when SirMordred initializes. The thread
   that read the list of projects didn't have time to even start before
   the manager finalizes it, so data backends didn't have any have any
   input to work with. This bug was originally reported by ncsibra-lab49
   on
   [grimoirelab#585](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/issues/585).

The following list describes the changes by component:

### grimoirelab-toolkit
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### kidash
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### sortinghat

**New features:**

 * Set top domain from UI (#729)\
   Add the option to set an organization's domain as top domain from the
   UI.
 * Order individuals by indentities (#732)\
   Adds the option to order the individuals by the number of identities
   they have.
 * Import identities automatically (#746)\
   Create a schema to import identities to SortingHat automatically using
   custom backends. The jobs will be executed periodically, at the given
   interval.  The tasks can be configured using the GraphQL API.  To
   create a custom importer you need to extend `IdentitiesImporter`,
   define a `NAME` for your importer (that will be used in the UI), and
   implement `get_identities` method that returns a list of individuals
   with the related identities that will be imported into SortingHat. If
   your importer requires extra parameters, you must extend the
   `__init__` method with the required parameters. Those parameters can
   be defined using the API.
 * Create account command\
   Include a new command to create users in SortingHat. The command can
   be executed as `sortinghat-admin create-user`.
 * Drag and drop to enroll in teams\
   Expanding an organization on the table now shows the full list of
   teams. Individuals can be dragged and dropped into a team and
   viceversa to affiliate them. The buttons to add, edit and delete
   organization and team information are reorganized into a dropdown menu
   to simplify the interface.
 * Multi-tenancy mode\
   SortingHat allows hosting multiple instances with a single service
   having each instance's data isolated in different databases. To enable
   this feature follow these guidelines: - Set `MULTI_TENANT` settings to
   `True`. - Define the tenants in `sortinghat/config/tenants.json`. -
   Assign users to tenants with `sortinghat-admin set-user-tenant`
   command.
 * Verify SSL option for client\
   Include an option for the client to verify if the certificate is
   valid. By default it is verified.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix outdated recommendation count (#733)\
   The number of remaining recommendations on the UI was wrong each time
   a recommendation was applied or dismissed.
 * Fix search syntax link (#735)\
   Fixes the link to the search syntax page on the search bar.

**Feature removals:**

 * Groups table removed from the UI\
   Groups and organizations are very similar, and having both tables in
   the dashboard can be confusing to users. To simplify the view, the
   table is removed from the user interface, but groups remain available
   through the API.

### cereslib

**New features:**

 * Support for more languages and file types\
   The library is able to detect the new file formats and language
   formats. This list includes JavaScript, TypeScript, Terraform, among
   others.

### perceval

**Bug fixes:**

 * Default value for mbox to-date (#810)\
   Include a default value for `--to-date` argument in mbox backend.

  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### perceval-opnfv
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### perceval-puppet
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### perceval-weblate
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### graal

**Dependencies updateds:**

 * Update package dependencies\
   Update package dependencies and pin `markdown-it-py` to a specific
   version.

### grimoire-elk

**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix typo in SortingHat fields\
   Some fields were not updated from the old version of SortingHat. Now
   the API returns 'isBot' and 'genderAcc' instead of 'is_bot' and
   'gender_acc'.

**Breaking changes:**

 * Define date format for Git documents\
   Git by default uses a custom date format that is not recognized by
   Elastic/OpenSearch.  Specify the format for the AuthorDate and
   CommitDate fields in Git documents to support the formats usually
   returned by `git log`.  This allows us to do proper filtering on these
   fields such as "all documents with CommitDate before 2020".
 * Update support for ES/OS versions > 7.X/1.X\
   Currently the support for ES/OS versions > 7.X/1.X is broken due to a
   faulty version check.  Add a static method to the Elasticsearch object
   that correctly checks whether the version is 'legacy' (defined as ES
   6.X or OS 0.X) and adds this check to various places in the codebase.
   Additionally, fixes an instance where `interval` is used instead of
   `fixed_interval`. `interval` was deprecated in ES7.

### sirmordred

**New features:**

 * SirMordred logs available on console\
   All SirMordred logs are now available on the console output. The
   `logs_dir` parameter in the `general` section is optional and it is
   only needed if you also want the logs in a file.
 * SortingHat option to verify SSL\
   Include `verify_ssl` option to SortingHat configuration to verify the
   connection with the server. By default it is `True`.

   The argument `--enterprise-url` for Gitlab backend has the new alias
   `--url`. With this argument, users can define the GitLab instance from
   items will be fetched. This can be set to the SaaS GitLab
   (`gitlab.com`) or to a self-managed instance (e.g.

**New features:**

 * Development and reviewing contributors fields for Git items\
   New information about the participants during the development and the
   reviewing processes are available in `Git` items. The Git backend
   extracts these data from `Approved-by`, `Co-authored-by`,  and
   `Merged-by` trailers that some commit messages might include. For each
   one of these trailers, new fields will be available with the suffixes:
   `_bots`, `_domains`, `_names`, `_org_names`, and `_uuids`. Also for
   each one of these suffixes, there will be extra fields with the prefix
   `non_authored_`. This is an example of the fields available for the
   the trailer `Merged-by`:     - merged_by_multi_bots     -
   merged_by_multi_domains     - merged_by_multi_names     -
   merged_by_multi_org_names     - merged_by_multi_uuids     -
   non_authored_merged_by_multi_bots     -
   non_authored_merged_by_multi_domains     -
   non_authored_merged_by_multi_names     -
   non_authored_merged_by_multi_org_names
 * Option 'to-date' on the backend sections\
   The option `to-date` on the `setup.cfg` allows fetching data until a
   specific date. By default, this value is `2100-01-01`.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Onion study on Github pull requests fixed\
   Github pull requests onion study is now updated to allow passing the
   study alias name by parameter.
 * Onion study on Gitlab fixed\
   Gitlab onion study is now updated to allow passing the study alias
   name by parameter.

**Dependencies updateds:**

 * New Pandas version\
   Update Pandas to the newest version compatible with Python 3.7+.

### sirmordred

**New features:**

 * New default GitHub pull requests alias names\
   GitHub pull_request category (github:pull) has its own aliases now:
   `github_pull_requests` and `github_pull_requests-raw`. This category
   used to share the default aliases for GitHub: `github` and `github-
   raw`.


## GrimoireLab 0.4.0 - (2022-06-29)

**New components:**

 * grimoirelab-toolkit 0.3.1

 * elk 0.102.0
 * sirmordred 0.3.1

### Perceval

**New features:**

 * [confluence] Option `max_contents` to limit the number of requested contents\
   This parameter sets the maximum number of contents requested per
   query. By default, this number is 200, but this can be changed by
   adding the `--max-contents` argument. This will help to bypass those
   instances where the maximum limit is lower than Perceval's default
   value.

**Bug fixes:**

 * [confluence] KeyError exception when arguments not passed to 'fetch_items'\
   Required arguments that weren't passed to 'fetch_items' made the code
   fail with a KeyError exception.
 * [bugzillarest] Failback when checking custom instances\
   Some Bugzilla instances return a HTTP 400 error when checking if their
   are custom instances or not. On those cases, the backend will capture
   the error and consider the version of that Bugzilla instance as
   custom.
 * [slack] Slack identifier extraction fixed\
   Extract the identifier without user information when the user was
   deleted.

## GrimoireLab 0.3.0 - (2022-06-07)

**Feature removals:**

 * Drop Python 3.6 support\
   Python 3.6 has reached the end of life in Dec 2021. This means it
   won't receive any further patches to fix the secutiry issues. So,
   dropping the support of 3.6 and it now supports Python>=3.7 version
   only.

**New components:**

 * grimoirelab-toolkit 0.3.0
 * perceval 0.18.0
 * perceval-mozilla 0.3.0
 * perceval-opnfv 0.2.0

The following list describes the changes by component:

### Perceval

**New features:**

 * [bugzillarest] API Key authentication\
   A new authentication is available in the `bugzillarest` backend using
   an API Key. This can be provided using the parameter `--api-key` on
   the command line. Note that this parameter will invalidate `--backend-
   user` `--backend-password`, and `--api-token` parameters. For
   developers, this parameter is also available during the initialization
   of the class `BugzillaRESTClient` under the name `api_key`.
 * Confluence supports fetch by spaces\
   This allows fetching confluence by specific spaces. By default it will
   fetch the entire instance, but adding the `--spaces` argument will
   fetch only these spaces.

### Graal

**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix error in update worktree\
   Graal wasn't working with the latest version of Git 2.35.1 because it
   protects braches checked out in all worktrees. This change renames the
   branch created when creating a worktree to fix the issue.
   
### Sorting Hat

**Bug fixes:**

 * [gitdm] Skip invalid format lines\
   Gitdm parser won't fail reading files with an invalid format. Instead,
   it will ignore invalid content.

### GrimoireELK

**New features:**

 * Anonymize parameters\
   A new API function `anonymize_params(params)` allows to anonymize a
   list of parameters that developers might consider secrets. It will
   only take effect for those parameters which their names are defined on
   `SECRET_PARAMETERS` constant.
 * Dependencies file for development\
   Include a new requirements.txt file to install the development version
   from the repositories.
 * Support to add identities to SortingHat from Enrich class\
   New methods `add_identities` and `add_identity` are available on
   `Enrich` class to add new identities to a `SortingHat` database.
   Libraries using `elk` won't need to use `sortinghat` library to store
   new identities while enriching items.
 * Collect and enrich confluence by spaces\
   Users can collect and enrich Confluence data from specific spaces
   only, adding the option `--spaces=[SPACE1, SPACE2, ...]` to their
   `projects.json`. The following example shows how to collect and to
   enrich data from only the `DEV` and `SUPP` spaces only. ``` {
   "project": {         "confluence": [             "http://example.com
   --spaces=[DEV, SUPP]"         ]     } } ```
 * Add demographic study to mattermost\
   Add the demographic study to the mattermost data source.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Skip sources with wrong arguments\
   Sources won't interrupt collection or enrichment processes when any of
   their arguments are invalid. Instead, they will be skipped.
 * Git fix 'is_git_commit_multi_author'\
   This fixes the `is_git_commit_multi_author` field when the commit has
   more than one author and `pair-programming` is enabled. This is
   important for calculating `pair_programming_*` values.
 * SortingHat as a required package\
   SortingHat is required for running grimoireelk but it was set as an
   extra dependency. From now on sortinghat is always installed with
   grimoireelk.
 * Confluence credentials not stored in raw indexes\
   Credentials for Confluence datasource were stored in raw indices as
   part of the URL. For now on, credentials that are part of URLs are
   removed before any data is stored.
 * Pair programming regular expression improvement\
   The regular expression to detect pair programming authors in git
   datasource has been improved adding more connectors. The following
   list shows the current connectors: - `[aA][nN][dD]` - `&` - `+`
 * Fix fetching authors with min and max dates\
   The old query only returns 10000 items due to ElasticSearch and
   OpenSearch now use `composite` aggregation to paginate all buckets.

### Sir Mordred

**New features:**

 * Add extract spaces\
   Extract spaces from the URL. By default it will extract labels but
   adding `tag_type="spaces"` it will extract spaces.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Studies aliases relocated\
   Relocate studies aliases so they are not created automatically by
   Mordred.
 * Add pair-programming in '_get_enrich_backend' method\
   Add the `pair-programming` to the `_get_enrich_backend` method if it
   exists in the setup.cfg file.

**Feature removals:**

 * FINOS Meeting backend removed\
   FINOS Meeting backend is not supported anymore. The Perceval backend
   was archived in Bitergia repository so it shouldn't be part of the
   core anymore because it's software not maintained.

**Others:**

 * Add studies to the alias file\
   Add onion, areas of code, and demographics studies to the file
   aliases.json. This is needed to keep this file updated with the
   aliases we use in the dashboards by adding them to the appropiate data
   sources. The included aliases: - all_onion - git_areas_of_code -
   demographics
