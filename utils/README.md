Utils, general to GrimoireLab.

## build_grimoirelab

Build packages (sdist, wheel) for all modules in GrimoireLab.
This program can build the packages corresponding to a coordinated release
of GrimoireLab, or to the current master/HEAD of all repos.
The build can use virtual environments for building everything,
can be installed for testing in a virtual environment too,
and can be checked for some invariants (such as modification of the
version file).
A set of modules to install can be selected, if we don't want to build
all of them.

Currently, this script can produce all packages for the repos that
already support Python packages,
and install them in a virtual environment where they could be tested.

To avoid problems with the Python installation in the host
where the packages are produced,
a virtual environment with installed dependencies for building is produced,
and packages are built in it.

The script accepts options to build, install, or check,
to select only a certain set of modules,
to define directories for building and installing virtual environments,
for the temporary repositories, for where to produce the Python packages,
and to select a coordinated release file.

The output (stdout) shows a summary of the process, including builds
and checks that failed. In general, any command that fails causes the
script to finish.

Examples:

* Build all modules in a coordinated release of GrimoireLab
(the one corresponding to `../releases/elasticgirl.16`),
producing the corresponding wheels and sdists in `/tmp/dist`,
cloning all git repos in `/tmp/repos`,
using for building a virtual environment in `/tmp/venv`,
installing all the modules in the virtual environment `/tmp/ivenv`
afterwards, including dependencies,
and running some checks on them.
Write log file in `/tmp/log`, using log level `debug`.

```bash
$ build_grimoirelab -l debug --logfile /tmp/log --build --install --check \
  --relfile ../releases/elasticgirl.16  --dist /tmp/dist \
  --repos /tmp/repos --venv /tmp/venv --install_venv /tmp/ivenv
```

The stdout shows how the process went, including builds or tests that
failed:

* Build all modules in a coordinated release of GrimoireLab
(the one corresponding to `../releases/elasticgirl.16`),
producing the corresponding wheels and sdists in `/tmp/dist`,
installing them in the virtual environment `/tmp/ivenv`
afterwards, including dependencies,

  --relfile ../releases/elasticgirl.16  --dist /tmp/dist \
  --install_venv /tmp/ivenv
```

* Build the `grimoire-kidash` module, as is in the `master/HEAD` commit
of its repository,
producing the corresponding wheels and sdists in `/tmp/dist`.

```bash
$ build_grimoirelab --build --relfile ../releases/elasticgirl.16  \
  --dist /tmp/dist  --modules grimoire-kidash
```

* Install modules available in `/tmp/dist` as wheels and sdists,
in the virtual environment `/tmp/ivenv`, including dependencies.

```bash
$ build_grimoirelab --install --dist /tmp/dist --install_venv /tmp/ivenv \
  --modules grimoire-kidash
```
